## Introduction
This project is the resurrection of the [CustomNPCs-Script-Editor](https://github.com/RainEffect/CustomNPCs-Script-Editor) project, and is currently under development. It is a visual script editor for the Minecraft mod [Custom NPCs](https://www.kodevelopment.nl/minecraft/customnpcs), powered by Google's [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly?hl=en) visual programming. You can build your Custom NPCs scripts easily with this editor.
